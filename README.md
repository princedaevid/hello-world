Hello David here !
  I'm David Bennin, from Ghana. Just joined github to explore and learn more from
  experienced programmers out there. I'm a programmer myself but now on the field of study.
  I really like programming, i just enjoy coding. I never feel lazy when coding or learning 
  programming. My aim is to be a professional programmer and an ethical hacker.
  I'll really enjoy the assist of any one who wanna help me know more, thanks.
